<strong>Ultimate TinyMCE</strong> will expand the default array of buttons in the visual tinymce editor, giving you the power to visually create your pages and posts. No need for mucking about in HTML and CSS.

<strong>Here are just a few features which make this plugin so powerful:</strong>
<ul><li>Create Page Breaks and split your post into multiple pages.</li><li>Insert YouTube videos by simply pasting the "share" link inside the popup window.</li><li>Format selected text using the subscript and superscript options.</li><li>Add, create, and manipulate as many tables as you like.  You can use these to create the effect of a two or three column layout within your post content.  (See the screenshots section for a visual example).</li><li>Add emoticons or animated smilies to your posts/pages.</li><li>Tons of text formatting options.</li><li>Advanced features for images (such as mouseover and mouseout).</li><li>Advanced features for ordered and unordered drop-down lists.</li><li>Easily add page anchors to posts that become too long to scroll through all the content.</li><li>Open links in your own javascript popup windows, without writing a single line of code.  You can even control the size and position of your popup window.</li><li><strong>And much more... too many features to list.</strong></li><li>This plugin is in very active development, and new versions will be released adding further customization and functionality.</li></ul>

<strong>Still reading??  How about some of these cool features?</strong>
<ul><li>Use image mapping to create separate links over the same image.  Great for using photoshop images as navigation.</li><li>Design a custom message box for your register/login page.  You can even include links, images, and video.</li><li>Do you always end your posts with the same text or image?  Use the "signoff" shortcode to add your custom code at any time.</li><li>A very active support forum.</li><li>A huge contextual help system accompanies this plugin.  Each option has it's very own help icon which will open a popup giving specific help messages and screenshots.</li><li>Toggle the option to enable shortcodes in your widget areas.</li><li>This plugin is very stable and works extremely well on the current version of wordpress and across multiple themes (both free and paid); and with other plugins.</li></ul>

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.
     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.

Note:  This plugin is a little on the "heavy" side... (just under 8 megabytes).  This is primarily because of the custom moods (but they're so darn cute) and contextual help system.  If space is a concern to you, please consider yourself warned.  For all others, please enjoy this feature-packed plugin!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Support Forum =

Please use my support forum <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">HERE</a> for expedited help.

= The text doesn't wrap at the end of the window and keeps going, creating a slider across the bottom of the window. =
I have found this to be because the line of text being entered has no spacing.  A single line of text, without any spacing, will cause the editor window to "grow".  Insert a space somewhere and the line will break to a new line.  

= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser if you want to use the colorpicker.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.</li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

== Features ==

* Retain div tags, iframe tags, embed tags, object tags, and more.
* Retain P and BR tags, by using a style. (See my support forum for more info).
* Add PHP widgets, which will allow you to run custom PHP code in your widgets.
* Signoff feature.  Do you always "sign" your posts with the same thing?  Now create it once, and insert it using a 7-letter shortcode.
* New animated smilies.  These will be sure to draw some pleasant attention to your blog.
* Now includes an admin panel to choose which buttons you would like to show in your editor.
* Complete control over custom CSS styles using drop-down lists.
* Advanced link and image inserts, including mouseover and mouseout, and even open links in javascript windows... all without writing a single line of code.
* Adds buttons for cut, copy, and paste.
* Adds a button to insert horizontal rows.
* A dropdown list for font-styles.
* A dropdown list for font-size.
* Adds colorpickers for font foreground and background colors.
* Adds anchors, making their usage extremely easy.  (Ever wondered how you click a link and it auto-scrolls you halfway down the page??  Here's how.)
* Includes a grand total of 48 emoticons... and counting.  See them in both your admin panel AND your pages/posts.
* Adds a new row for adding tables and manipulating their properties individually.  Add as many tables as you like, and change the properties of each, without affecting your other tables.

* Simply too many features to list!!

== Changelog ==

= 1.6.9 =
* Added a separate button for the "Advanced Insert/Edit Link" feature.  Now, you have a new button next to the wordpress buttons for linking and unlinking.  No more having to go back and forth to the plugin settings page.  Check the help file in the plugin settings page for more info.
* Updated my documentation to help with the link features.  Please let me know if you spot any inconsistencies.
* Added a button for turning on/off Visual Characters.
* Added a button which allows you to print your post from the editor.
* Added a button for automatically inserting the date or the time.  Let me know if this feature is useful, and if so, I can add some custom options allowing you to set how you want your date or time to be displayed.
* I am seriously considering removing the "Animated Moods" feature.  This would free up about 5 megabytes of space to allow for newer features.  I'm already nearing 10 megabytes on the plugin now.  So, if this is of dire need to you, please use my forum or my contact form to voice your opinion.

= 1.6.8 =
* Removed the old tables option and replaced it with a new drop-down box table button.  This consolidated all the table buttons into a nicely organized drop-down list.  You still have the exact same options.
* Added a "Next Page" feature.  This will allow you to use the wordpress page break to "break" your post into multiple pages.  Click the help icon in the admin settings page for more information and examples.
* Added additional font sizes.  The drop-down list will look a little "funny", but if you hover over the font, it will tell you the size.
* Removed the custom register/login box option.  I have created a different plugin with this feature.  If you liked it, please download the plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-welcome-messages/">HERE</a>.
* Moved the 'styles' button to the first position in row 4 of the editor.  This helped with spacing issues.
* Made a few width and height adjustments in the 'emotions' and 'youtube' popup windows.
* Updated Bloggers section.
* Slightly modified the feedback form.
* Added a "Plugin Poll" to find out the demand for newer features.
* Added a Mozilla Firefox box and link to admin settings page.  In my opinion, Firefox is the best browser to use with the visual tinymce editor.
* Removed some miscellaneous junk files and code.

= 1.6.7 =
* Added more to the contextual help sections.
* Removed the toggle switch, as it was not compatible across browsers.  I will tweak some more and add again in a future update.
* Tweaked the editor button popup windows with some custom css.  Trying to make them a little more "pleasing" on the eyes.
* Insert and Cancel buttons in the popups are now colorized.
* Working on implementing yet another settings section, which will allow fine-tuning over the tinymce initialization process.  I have most of the code in place, but still working out the last few bugs.  This should be fully operational in my next update.


= 1.6.6 =
* Implemented a new dropdown table buttons feature.  Instead of having 11 buttons side by side, taking up valuable real estate, this new option will add a dropdown list for the different buttons.  A HUGE space saver!
* Implemented a new HTML viewer button.  This one is Awesome!!  Complete with syntax highlighter, line numbers, auto-complete, and undo,redo history.
* Added a YouTube button.  This will allow you to simply enter the video id and the plugin does the rest, embedding the video directly into your post/page.
* Added a cool feature using Image Maps.  You can create basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and polygons; and insert them over an image, and they will each link to a separate place or content.
* Designed a toggle switch that will "hide" and "show" all the rows of the editor.
* I moved a lot of the CSS files around and made them easier for me to navigate while continuing plugin development.  If some of your CSS doesn't load properly, make sure to empty any cache you are using on your website; clear your browsers cache; and reload the page.


= 1.6.5 =
* Updated most of the contextual help sections.
* Tables will have to wait until the next update (I want to be specific with this one).
* Removed the Microsoft Word Help Document.  I will make this available as a download on my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">Support Forum</a> for anyone interested.
* Fixed missing reference to stylesheet "pop-upstyle.css".

= 1.6.4 =
* Added support for shortcode usage in widget areas.  You can now use any shortcode available in your theme (or other plugins) in your widget areas.
* I'm In process of performing a HUGE contextual help system.  Each option now has a little "Help" icon, which when clicked will open a new window with help information specific to that option.
* This will be a "work-in-progress" over the next few updates.
* Switched my Feedback Form to another provider.  It should remain in working order from here on out.

= 1.6.3 =
* Added a custom message box which will display on your register/login page. This is available from within the admin panel settings page. Simply "check" the box, enter your message, and it will magically be displayed on your register/login form just above the login box. This can, of course, be styled however you like.
* Added an option to enable the tinymce editor within the post/page excerpt box. Now, you can create your custom excerpts using the power of Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added an option to show the post/page ID in the admin menu for posts and pages. This is extremely helpful if you are using plugins which require you to enter the post or page ID. A HUGE timesaver.
* Added a few more "Save your Selection" buttons, so it's not just one button at the bottom of the page.  It doesn't matter which button your use, they all function the same.  It's more for convenience.
* Be sure to visit my support forum to see usage examples of Ultimate TinyMCE.  It's the best way to follow along with updates, video and image turorials, and knowledgeable community members. http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1
* The direct URL for the new features included in this update is here:  http://www.forum.joshlobe.com/showthread.php?tid=19
* As always, please go back and click "Works" again to help spread this plugin.

= 1.6.2 =
* Added support for div, iframe, object, param, embed, and pre tags.  You can now safely use these tags (and any attributes) while switching between Visual and HTML mode.  Also, they will not be stripped away when you publish a page.
* Incorporated some of the functionality from "TinyMCE Clear".  This allows you to use "clear div" tags and elements.  This option will have to be selected in the admin panel "Ultimate TinyMCE" settings page.  It will also add three new buttons to row 1 of the editor in Visual mode.
* You can now retain P and BR tags, if you use a style.  Please see my <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">SUPPORT FORUM</a> for more information about how to use this feature.
* Be sure to check the <a href="http://forum.joshlobe.com/member.php?action=register&referrer=1">FORUM</a> anyway.  I have also added some news about newfound Keyboard Shortcuts.
* If you're happy and you know it... please go back and click "works" again for the new version.


= 1.6.1 =
* Added a new options box on the settings page for enabling/disabling two of the advanced features; Advanced Link and Custom Styles.
* These two features will be disabled by default when activating the upgrade.  If you use these features, you must "check" them in the admin panel settings page.
* Leaving these boxes "unchecked" will restore the default WordPress functionality of the insert/edit link button and the styles dropdown list respectively.
* My form only allows 100 submissions per month (free service).  So, if my feedback form doesn't show, you know why.
* Additional testing for compatibility with WordPress 3.3.  No known issues at this time.

= 1.6.0 =
* Added a community support forum for more concentrated and expedited help.  The links can be found in the Ultimate TiynMCE settings panel, or on the active plugins page under Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Added a section in the settings page for bloggers.  Read the info, and follow along if you like this plugin.
* Added code templates for my next few planned upgrades.

= 1.5.9 =
* Fixed bug where tinymce was adding crazy white space.  I thought my last release had fixed this issue, but apparently it's not ready.
* I could use some extra testers for new versions.  If interested, please contact me using one of the methods on the plugin main download page.  Thanks.

= 1.5.8 =
* Working on ways to make formatting not get stripped by tinymce.  Added default ability of transforming use of the enter key into "&nbsp" characters.  This should help with line spacing when switching between Visual and HTML modes.
* Adjusted various default behaviors of the tinymce initialization process.
* Added Dutch and Finnish Translations.

<strong>New Features:</strong>

* Added ability to use PHP code inside text widgets.
* Added a signoff shortcode feature.  If you always "sign" your posts the same way, this option will allow you to insert it into your editor via a simple shortcode.
* Both of these can be enabled/disabled in the settings menu.

= 1.5.7 =
* Received a few messages regarding the buttons disappearing when activating the plugin.  This was caused by the __construct() function conflicting with other plugins using the same function.  I rewrote the code so the construct function is no longer needed.  This has helped speed up tinymce loading time significantly.
* Added Japanese to the language translations.

= 1.5.6 =

* Changed all text strings to support language localization.  Please contact me if you would like to help with a translation.
* Fixed image paths to support wordpress installations in subdirectories.  Thanks to Redcocker - http://www.near-mint.com/blog/

= 1.5.5 =

* Added functionality to create shortcodes for use within the editor. (Please see the Microsoft Word documentation on the plugin settings page in the admin panel for complete usage instructions).
* Updated the Microsoft Word documentation to include support for iframe's.

= 1.5.4 =

* Added a couple of screencasts and a word document to help with how to use the TinyMCE.  These can be found in the admin panel settings page, under "Additional Resources".
* Added a few advanced featuers to the HR button.  This button will again be un-selected by default.  You will need to re-enable the button in the admin panel.
* Cleaned up some code, and reduced some of the functions into arrays.  This will have a pretty unnoticeable, yet still effective, decrease in tinymce loading time.

= 1.5.3 =

* Added a button for working with embedding audio, video, and flash files.
* Added a custom styles drop-down list... with plans on adding more.  Please let me know what you would like included here.
* Added a form to the admin settings page; please use this form to pass along your ideas to me.

= 1.5.2 =

* I've been working on this one for a while... You're going to love it!!  ULTIMATE MOODS.
* Ultimate Moods will add a new button in your visual editor window.  You will have over fifty, nifty, thrifty little animated smilies to choose from and insert them directly into your posts/pages.
* This little upgrade is sure to bring a new "look and feel" to your blogpages.  It's both FUN and FRESH!!
* Remember you will need to enable the button in the admin panel settings page.
* I'm thinking about working on a paid version which will include hundreds of new animated moods.  Please give me some feedback and let me know what you think.
* Don't forget to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A9E5VNRBMVBCS">donate</a> if you can spare a dollar or two ;)  This upgrade took some time, and I'm sure many of you will enjoy.
* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.


= 1.5.1 =

* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Noted the "save" buttons to make aware you must click the save button for each row accordingly.
* Added "settings" link to the plugin page where plugins are listed.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed bug where Row 3 buttons were not saving.

= 1.4 =

* Beautified the admin panel for button selection.
* Renamed my functions so they will be unique.
* Added resources tab in admin panel linking to help sections.

= 1.3 =

* Replaced "Example Text" with small icons of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 1.2 =

* Added an admin control where you can choose which buttons you would like to display in the editor.
* Adds an option menu in the admin panel under Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE.
* Simply select which buttons you would like to add to your editor.
* Note: All buttons are NOT selected by default on first install.

= 1.1 =

* This plugin is exactly like my Ultimate Visual Editor Upgrade plugin; except this plugin does NOT include the 291 Google Webfonts.  I realized the increased load the fonts puts on the server because each font calls a separate HTML request.  So, I created this plugin to use in the mean time until I can figure out a better solution.
* Plugin was created.
